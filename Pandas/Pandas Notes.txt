In simple words
---------------
Pandas is a Python library.
Pandas is used to analyze data.

Why Use Pandas?
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Relevant data is very important in data science.

What Can Pandas Do?
Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
What is average value?
Max value?
Min value?
Pandas are also able to delete rows that are not relevant, or contains wrong values, 
like empty or NULL values. This is called cleaning the data.

Where is the Pandas Codebase?
The source code for Pandas is located at this github repository https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas

import pandas
	import pandas as pd (here pd is the alias for pandas, later onwards pd can be used instead of pandas)


Different datatypes in pandas
	-Series - 1D data
	-DataFrame - 2D data - this is the most common datatype
	-Panel - 3D data

Pandas Series
